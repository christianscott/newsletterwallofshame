      <h1>The Newsletter Wall of Shame</h1>
      <p>
        There's one golden rule of mailing lists, and luckily it's very simple. If I click the unsubscribe link at the
        bottom of your email,
        <span class="font-weight-bold">I should never hear from you again.</span>
      </p>

      <p>Far too many companies screw this up. Here are some common near-misses that make my eyes twitch:</p>

      <p class="highlight-section highlight-section--blue position-relative">
        <span class="font-weight-bold">I have to sign in to your site before you'll unsubscribe me.</span> You already
        know who I am &mdash; you're tracking every other link in the email.
      </p>

      <p class="highlight-section highlight-section--blue position-relative">
        <span class="font-weight-bold">You promise to stop emailing me some amount of time after I unsubscribe.</span>
        Are you snail-mailing my email address to MailChimp on a hand written postcard?
      </p>

      <p class="highlight-section highlight-section--blue position-relative">
        <span class="font-weight-bold"
          >You only unsubscribe me from 1 of the 10,000 mailing lists you've put me on.</span
        >
        Believe it or not, I hate your monthly updates as much as I hate your weekly updates.
      </p>

      <p>
        To encourage you to change your ways, here's a naughty list that you'll appear on if you violate this oh-so
        simple rule.
